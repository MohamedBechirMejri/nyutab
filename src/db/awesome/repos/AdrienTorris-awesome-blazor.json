We could use the provided Bold Reports Viewer to display the reports, but that does not always fit with what you want to accomplish. That is why today we will implement a report viewer in a Blazor Server application. That way, we can show our custom report to our clients directly inside of our site instead of sending them to a separate application."},{"name":"Bringing WebAssembly to the .NET Mainstream","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIeYw7kJUIg","description":"Steve Sanderson -  May 19, 2022 - Many developers still consider WebAssembly to be a leading-edge, niche technology tied to low-level systems programming languages. However, C# and .NET have run on WebAssembly since 2017. Blazor WebAssembly brought .NET into the browser on open standards, and is now one of the fastest-growing parts of .NET across enterprises, startups, and hobbyists. Next, with WASI we could let you run .NET in even more places, introducing cloud-native tools and techniques to a wider segment of the global developer community. This is a technical talk showing how we bring .NET to WebAssembly. Steve will demonstrate how it runs both interpreted and AOT-compiled, how an IDE debugger can attach, performance tradeoffs, and how a move from Emscripten to WASI SDK lets it run in Wasmtime/Wasmer or higher-level runtimes like wasmCloud. Secondly, you'll hear lessons learned from Blazor as an open-source project - challenges and misconceptions faced bringing WebAssembly beyond early adopters."},{"name":"Rapid development model for Blazor Web Assembly and typed end-to-end services","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcQqCzm4tK0","description":" May 19, 2022 - In this video we use the ServiceStack Blazor WASM template to show how the combination of typed end-to-end services and Blazor is great for building line of business applications.

Real-world software projects often involve combining many technologies. So, is modern Blazor powerful and flexible enough for your team's needs? In this demo-heavy talk, Steve will show how Blazor WebAssembly/Server can seamlessly embed libraries and logic written in other languages such as Rust or C/C++, how Blazor WebAssembly/Server components can be used inside other SPA frameworks such as React or Angular (or vice-versa) and how Blazor components can be used not only for web projects, but also shared with native apps for macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows (including WPF and WinForms) These capabilities should equip your team to take on the most ambitious projects with confidence. We'll then look further into the future and consider how WebAssembly is moving beyond the browser and is pitched to become a foundational element of cloud-native server apps. You'll be among the first to see an experimental new approach to compiling .NET applications into WASI-compliant universal binaries that can run on any OS or processor, robustly sandboxed and with great performance."},{"name":"Creating Office Files in Blazor using Syncfusion","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyoCxzRLUsQ","description":"PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint -  May 13, 2022 - Creating office files in C# has always been a popular solution.

In this video, we will look at the DataGrid, charts, a Kanban-style board, a dashboard, autocomplete textboxes, context menus, signature pads, menu bars, toast messages, and more. There are so many controls to look at, in fact, that we are going to purposefully ignore the office file creation and display controls, as well as reporting. That way, we can spend more time on the other controls today and then focus on the office files in another video. The reporting will actually have two different videos dedicated to it."},{"name":"Securing SPAs and Blazor Applications using the BFF (Backend for Frontend) Pattern","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdNssiaIY_Q","description":" May 10, 2022 - Modern web development means that more and more application code is running in the browser. Traditionally this has been JavaScript but more recently there has been the trend to use C#/WASM with Blazor. These modern applications typically also need authentication and single-sign-on as well as token-based security for calling APIs – in other words OpenID Connect and OAuth 2. There are different patterns for securing such applications and this session covers some of the pitfalls of the various approaches, especially given the ever-changing browser landscape. We will conclude with the “backend for frontend” (or BFF) pattern which has become the most secure and stable of these approaches."},{"name":"Multi-environment deployments with Azure DevOps and Static Web Apps","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JkfeZp7aDk","description":" May 5, 2022 - App walkthrough, Create a static web app with an Azure DevOps pipeline, Add Azure DevOps environments and configure approvals, Configure a multi-stage pipeline, Static Web Apps named preview environments, Playwright tests, Manual approval before production deployment, Secure staging environments with a password.

Your components can access native functionality through the .NET platform, and they render standard web UI. .NET MAUI Blazor apps can run anywhere .NET MAUI can (Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android)."},{"name":"Managing App State with Fluxor","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn6dKN_hTrs","description":" March 31, 2022 - pp State Management using Fluxor, a Flux/Redux library for Blazor."},{"name":"Blazor Basics with Identity","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGabdG5Ge8Y","description":" Mars 14, 2022 - Fritz shows you how to connect authentication and authorization to your Blazor app.  We'll focus on how to connect a properly configured Microsoft Identity application to your Blazor framework."},{"name":"ASP.NET Community Standup","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UM6s0QPvRQ","description":"Native client apps with Blazor Hybrid -  Mars 8, 2022 - Join this Blazor Community Standup to learn more about using Blazor Hybrid to create cross-platform native client apps for Windows, iOS, Android & Mac.

It’s fast becoming one of the top frameworks to use when styling applications. It offers a different approach to the traditional frameworks like Bootstrap—utility based styling. Rather than using prebuilt components—which result in your application looking like a lot of others on the web—you can tailor your design by applying small focused CSS classes resulting in a unique style for your app. In this talk, you will learn how to bring the power of Tailwind CSS to your Blazor applications. We’ll start off with an introduction to Tailwind and how it differs from other CSS frameworks. Then we’ll get into some code and see how we can integrate Tailwind with Blazor. For the rest of the time, we’ll explore the various features of Tailwind and see how just how beautiful we can make our Blazor app. By Chris Sainty, at the NDC Oslo 2021."},{"name":"Best practices unit testing Blazor components with bUnit","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co7QetPYiO4","description":" Mars 1, 2022 - Why create tests of UI components?
